TODO
* Pseudolabel Method: Add points with label 1
-- Add single point mode [done]
-- warm starting [reverted, not good]
-- should work well in separable [need to test...]
-- ?? only count true labels?
-- Added training fpr/fnr, need to review..


NEED
======
eps greedy says yes, model is negative, our model's p(success) depends on false positive/false negative

prove it's not curriculum epsilon greedy.




sanity checks:
-- start with a lot of data, then see fpr [pull it together from unbiased]
[small batch], like 1-2 points
pray it's not possible with good model
***** this actually does well!

-- try larger batches?
[not whole dataset...]
**** this does well too

-- i think we need adaptive/adversarial dataset
try adapting adult dataset, no discrimination
*** should we burn in first? run eps-greedy for a while?


POST_DISCUSSION
** prefer RARE instead of non-stationarity
-- try this RIGHT AWAY -- add pixels to MNIST bottom corner!!!
   bottom right = accept, bottom left = reject 5
[adult dataset: income prediction from census]
move the dot around! [do somethign simpler since were just attacking greedy]
 METHOD 1: postprocess epsilon greedy!!!!
 METHOD 2: take epsilon most -- bounded optimism
[maximally avoid false negatives]


should converge for anything separable?

KEY: with iid data, and good modle, can we accept? PRAY NO
KEY: with adversarial data, and good modle, can we accept? PRAY YES

-- only sample a few, 1/1000 for accept



* Computation
-- GPU Code
-- norms for the unbiased models?

* Counterfactual Method: Make sure we only reoptimize for negatives
-- don't actually take arg max, approximated
-- batched version is tricky, but needed
-- Regularization? not a clear trend in weight norm.


DONE
* Fix baseline plots (pytorch_experiments)
* Fix MNIST download
* Added fpr/fnr/weight norm
* Evaluate at zero loss bound
* Added struct for False positives/false negatives/weight norm
* Fix ray for cluster -- MAJOR KEY
* Why train for fixed steps, instead of stopping criteria? (exp_regret)
    use stopping criteria now everywhere
* SRT Submission -- due Friday
DONE TODO: fix stuff
-- Add in epsilon greedy, add in greedy
-- use training with stopping
-- no warmstarting...




RESULTS
1. Network size: 40 node 1/2 runtime of 10 node on multisvm, 30t
 -- 100 node ~= 40 node runtime.
2. Adult is almost done on all the 30ts
-- took 16 hours for 30t on 40 nodes
3. _v2 now means batch size converted from 10 to 32.
